    "Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS- Random forest regressor is a machine learning algorithm that uses ensemble learning to improve the accuracy of regression models. \n",
    "     Ensemble learning is a technique that combines multiple models to produce a more accurate model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest regressor works by training multiple decision trees on bootstrap samples of the data. Bootstrap samples are created by sampling the \n",
    "data with replacement, which means that some data points may be included in more than one bootstrap sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision trees in a random forest are trained independently of each other. This means that each decision tree is trained on a different bootstrap \n",
    "sample of the data. The predictions of the individual decision trees are then averaged to produce a final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The averaging of the predictions of the individual decision trees helps to reduce overfitting and improve the accuracy of the random forest regressor. \n",
    "Overfitting is a problem that occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well and is not able to generalize to new data.\n",

    "1. Accuracy: Random forest regressor is a very accurate machine learning algorithm. It can often achieve better accuracy than other regression \n",
    "             algorithms.\n",
    "2. Robustness: Random forest regressor is a robust algorithm that is not sensitive to noise in the data. This means that it can still produce \n",

    "3. Interpretability: Random forest regressor is an interpretable algorithm. This means that it is possible to understand how the algorithm makes \n",

    "ANS- Random forest regressor reduces the risk of overfitting in a few ways:\n",

    "1. Bootstrapping: Bootstrapping is a technique that is used to create multiple bootstrap samples of the data. Bootstrap samples are created by \n",

    "\n",
    "Here is a more detailed explanation of how each of these techniques works:\n",

    "3. Averaging: Averaging the predictions of the individual decision trees helps to reduce the variance of the model and improve its accuracy. This is \n",
